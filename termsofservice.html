<h2>1. Who can use the app</h2>

<p>Lifeslice provides an app that helps users create content together. Users can start either playlists or chains and invite their friends to contribute by adding short videos. When completed, the videos can be compiled and either shared on social media, sent to specific recipients, downloaded or simply be saved on Lifeslice (“Lifeslice video”).</p>

<p><strong>Eligibility</strong></p>
<p>You may use the App only if you can form a binding contract with Lifeslice, and only in compliance with this Agreement and all applicable local, national, and international laws, rules and regulations. Any use or access to the App by anyone under 13 is strictly prohibited and in violation of this Agreement. We or our partners may offer additional Services with additional Terms that may require you to be even older to use them. The App is not available to any Users previously removed from the App by Lifeslice.</p>

<p><strong>Lifeslice App</strong></p>
<p>Subject to the Terms and conditions of this Agreement, you are hereby granted a non-exclusive, limited, non-transferable, freely revocable license to use the App for your personal, private, noncommercial use, and only in accordance with the features of the App as it is marketed by Lifeslice. Lifeslice reserves all rights not expressly granted herein in the App and the Lifeslice IP (as defined below). Lifeslice may terminate this license at any time for any reason or no reason.</p>

<p><strong>Commercial Use.</strong></p>
<p>You may not use the Lifeslice App for commercial purposes unless you are the copyright holder or you have obtained all necessary rights and licenses to use for commercial purposes all images, musical works, sound recording, narration, and other material that make up your User Content.</p>

<p><strong>Lifeslice Accounts</strong></p>
<p>Your Lifeslice account gives you access to the App and functionality that we may establish and maintain from time to time and in our sole discretion. By connecting to Lifeslice with a third-party service, you give us permission to access and use your information from that service as permitted by that service, and to store your log-in credentials for that service.</p>

<p>You may never use another User’s account without permission. When creating your account, you must provide accurate and complete information. You are solely responsible for the activity that occurs on your account, and you must keep your account password secure. We encourage you to use “strong” passwords (passwords that use a combination of upper and lower case letters, numbers and symbols) with your account. You must notify Lifeslice immediately of any breach of security or unauthorized use of your account. Lifeslice will not be liable for any losses caused by any unauthorized use of your account.</p>

<p>You may control your User profile and how you interact with the App by changing the settings in the mobile app. By providing Lifeslice your email address you consent to our using the email address to send you App-related notices, including any notices required by law, in lieu of communication by postal mail. We may also use your email address to send you other messages, such as changes to features of the App and special offers.</p>

<p><strong>Usage Rules</strong></p>
<p>You agree not to engage in any of the following prohibited activities: (i) copying, distributing, or disclosing any part of the App in any medium, including without limitation by any automated or non-automated “scraping”; (ii) using any automated system, including without limitation “robots,” “spiders,” “offline readers,” etc., to access the App in a manner that sends more request messages to the Lifeslice servers than a human can reasonably produce in the same period of time by using a conventional on-line web browser; (iii) transmitting spam, chain letters, or other unsolicited email; (iv) attempting to interfere with, compromise the system integrity or security or decipher any transmissions to or from the servers running the App; (v) taking any action that imposes, or may impose at our sole discretion an unreasonable or disproportionately large load on our infrastructure; (vi) uploading invalid data, viruses, worms, or other software agents through the App; (vii) collecting or harvesting any personally identifiable information, including account names, from the App; (viii) using the App for any commercial purposes without having all necessary rights and licenses to the User Content; (ix) impersonating another person or otherwise misrepresenting your affiliation with a person or entity, conducting fraud, hiding or attempting to hide your identity; (x) interfering with the proper working of the App; (xi) accessing any content on the App through any technology or means other than those capabilities provided by the App; or (xii) bypassing the measures we may use to prevent or restrict access to the App, including without limitation features that prevent or restrict use or copying of any content or enforce limitations on use of the App or the content therein.</p>

<p>You acknowledge that the terms of agreement with your respective mobile network provider will continue to apply when using the Application. As a result, you may be charged by the Mobile Provider for access to network connection services for the duration of the connection while accessing the Application or any such third party charges as may arise. You accept responsibility for any such charges that arise.</p>
<p>If you are not the bill payer for the mobile telephone or handheld device being used to access the Application, you will be assumed to have received permission from the bill payer for using the Application</p>

<p>We may, without prior notice, change the App, stop providing the App or features of the App, to you or to Users generally, or create usage limits for the App. We may permanently or temporarily terminate or suspend your access to the App, or delete any User Content (as defined below), without notice and liability for any reason, including if in our sole determination you violate any provision of this Agreement, or for no reason. Upon termination for any reason or no reason, you continue to be bound by this Agreement.</p>

<h2>2. Users content</h2>

<p>Many of our Services let you create, upload, post, send, receive, and store content. When you do this, you retain whatever ownership rights of that content you had to begin with. We claim no ownership rights over User Content created by you. Lifeslice has the right (but not the obligation) in its sole discretion to remove any User Content that is stored via the App.</p>

<p>By agreeing with those Terms of service you grant Lifeslice a worldwide, perpetual, royalty-free, sub-licensable, and transferable license to host, store, use, display, reproduce, modify, adapt, edit, publish, create derivative works from, publicly perform, broadcast, distribute, syndicate, promote, exhibit, and publicly display that content in any form and in any and all media or distribution methods (now known or later developed). We will use this license for the limited purpose of operating, developing, providing, promoting, and improving the Services; researching and developing new ones; and making content submitted through the Services available to our business partners for syndication, broadcast, distribution, or publication outside the Services. Some Services offer you tools to control who can—and cannot—see your content under this license. For more information about how to tailor who can watch your content, please take a look at our privacy policy and support site.</p>

<p>To the extent it’s necessary, you also grant Lifeslice and our business partners the unrestricted, worldwide, perpetual right and license to use your name, likeness, and voice in any and all media and distribution channels (now known or later developed) in connection with any Live Story or other crowd-sourced content you create, upload, post, send, or appear in. This means, among other things, that you will not be entitled to any compensation from Lifeslice or our business partners if your name, likeness, or voice is conveyed through the Services.</p>

<p>While we’re not required to do so, we may access, review, screen, and delete your content at any time and for any reason, including if we think your content violates these Terms. You alone though remain responsible for the content you create, post, store, or send through the Services.</p>

<p>Please keep in mind that we can use your ideas without compensating you, and by accepting the terms of this agreement you understand that you totally renounce to any compensation of any kind regarding their total or partial usage and gives us all right using them in our applications one way or another.</p>

<p>You agree not to post, store, transmit, create or share any User Content that: (i) may create a risk of harm, loss, physical or mental injury, emotional distress, death, disability, disfigurement, or physical or mental illness to you, to any other person, or to any animal; (ii) may create a risk of any other loss or damage to any person or property; (iii) seeks to harm or exploit children by exposing them to inappropriate content, asking for personally identifiable details or otherwise; (iv) may constitute or contribute to a crime or tort; (v) contains any information or content that we deem to be unlawful, harmful, abusive, racially or ethnically offensive, defamatory, infringing, invasive of personal privacy or publicity rights, harassing, humiliating to other people (publicly or otherwise), libelous, threatening, profane, or otherwise objectionable; (vi) contains any information or content that is illegal (including, without limitation, the disclosure of insider information under securities law or of another party’s trade secrets); or (vii) contains any information or content that you do not have a right to make available under any law or under contractual or fiduciary relationships. You agree that any User Content that you create, store, or share does not and will not violate third-party rights of any kind, including without limitation any Intellectual Property Rights (as defined below) or rights of privacy. Lifeslice reserves the right, but is not obligated, to reject and/or remove any User Content that Lifeslice believes, in its sole discretion, violates these provisions.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this Agreement, “Intellectual Property Rights” means all patent rights, copyright rights, mask work rights, moral rights, rights of publicity, trademark, trade dress and service mark rights, goodwill, trade secret rights and other intellectual property rights as may now exist or hereafter come into existence, and all applications therefore and registrations, renewals and extensions thereof, under the laws of any state, country, territory or other jurisdiction.</p>

<h2>3. Other users content</h2>

<p>Much of the content on our Services is produced by users, publishers, and other third parties. Whether that content is posted publicly or sent privately, the content is the sole responsibility of the person or organization that created it. Although Lifeslice reserves the right to review all content that appears on the Services and to remove any content that violates these Terms, we do not necessarily review all of it. So we cannot—and do not—take responsibility for any content that others provide through the Services.</p>

<p>Through these Terms of Service, we make clear that we do not want the Services put to bad uses. But because we do not review all content, we cannot guarantee that content on the Services will always conform to our Terms or Guidelines.</p>

<h2>8. Third party links</h2>

<p>The App may contain links to third-party websites, advertisers, services, special offers, or other events or activities that are not owned or controlled by Lifeslice. Lifeslice does not endorse or assume any responsibility for any such third-party sites, information, materials, products, or services. If you access a third party website from the App, you do so at your own risk, and you understand that this Agreement and Lifeslice’s Privacy Policy do not apply to your use of such sites. You expressly relieve Lifeslice from any and all liability arising from your use of any third-party website, service, or content. Additionally, your dealings with or participation in promotions of advertisers found on the App, including payment and delivery of goods, and any other Terms (such as warranties) are solely between you and such advertisers. You agree that Lifeslice shall not be responsible for any loss or damage of any sort relating to your dealings with such advertisers.</p>

<h2>9. In app purchase and Payments</h2>

<p>We may offer various virtual goods and services (all of which we call “Products”) that you can purchase and use through the Services. You don’t own these Products; instead you buy a limited revocable license to use them. You’ll always be shown the price for any Product before you complete the purchase. But Lifeslice does not handle payments or payment processing for in-app purchases; those are handled by the app store you use (such as Apple’s App Store or Google’s Play Store). The app store you use may charge you sales tax, depending on where you live. Please check the app store’s relevant Terms for details.</p>

<p>All in-app sales are final and non-refundable. And because our performance begins once you tap “Buy” and we give you immediate access to your purchase, you waive any right you may have under EU or other local law to cancel your purchase once it’s completed or to get a refund. BY ACCEPTING THESE Terms, YOU AGREE THAT LIFESLICE IS NOT REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REFUND FOR ANY REASON.</p>

<p>Some of the Products we offer are for one-time use only, while others are for repeated use. But please note that “repeated” does not mean “forever.” We may change, modify, or eliminate Products at any time, with or without notice. You agree that we will bear no liability to you or any third party if we do so. If we suspend or terminate your account, you will lose any Products you purchased through the Services.</p>

<p>It’s your sole responsibility to manage your in-app purchases. For information about how to restrict in-app purchases on your device, please consult your app store’s Terms. If you are under 18, you must obtain your parent’s or guardian’s consent before making any purchases.</p>

<p>Lifeslice does not transmit any funds and is not a money-services business. To the extent such functionality is made available in the Services, it is provided by an unaffiliated third party, and like any other third-party service, subject to that third party’s separate Terms of service.</p>

<h2>10. Indemnity</h2>

<p>You agree to defend, indemnify and hold harmless Lifeslice and its subsidiaries, agents, licensors, managers, and other affiliated companies, and their employees, contractors, agents, officers and directors, from and against any and all claims, damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to attorney’s fees) arising from: (i) your use of and access to the App, including any data or content transmitted or received by you; (ii) your violation of any term of this Agreement, including without limitation your breach of any of the representations and warranties above; (iii) your violation of any third-party right, including without limitation any right of privacy or Intellectual Property Rights; (iv) your violation of any applicable law, rule or regulation; (v) any claim or damages that arise as a result of any of your User Content, including without limitation any User Content, or any that is created, stored, shared or submitted via your account; or (vi) any other party’s access and use of the App with your unique username, password or other appropriate security code.</p>

<h2>11. Data charges and Mobile phones</h2>

<p>You are responsible for any mobile charges that you may incur for using our Services, including text-messaging and data charges. If you’re unsure what those charges may be, you should ask your service provider before using the Services.</p>

<p>If you change or deactivate the mobile phone number that you used to create a Lifeslice account, you must update your account information through Settings within 72 hours to prevent us from sending to someone else messages intended for you.</p>

<h2>12. Modifying the Services and Termination</h2>

<p>We’re relentlessly improving our Services and creating new ones all the time. That means we may add or remove features or functionalities, and we may also suspend or stop the Services altogether. We may take any of these actions at any time, and when we do, we may not provide you with any notice beforehand.</p>

<p>While we hope you remain a lifelong user, you can terminate these Terms at any time and for any reason by deleting your account or uninstalling the app from your device.</p>

<p>Lifeslice may also terminate these Terms with you at any time, for any reason, by giving notice of termination to you with a simple email without any delay.   . That means that we may stop providing you with any Services, or impose new or additional limits on your ability to use the Services. For example, we may deactivate or delete your account due to prolonged inactivity, and we may reclaim your username at any time for any reason. If you were to try to retrieve a deactivated account, the reactivation could come at a price that should be decided at our discretion.</p>

<p>Regardless of who terminates these Terms, both you and Lifeslice continue to be bound by Sections 2, 3, 4, 9, 12-16 of the Terms.</p>

<h2>13. Disclaimer</h2>

<p>No Waiver. No waiver of any term of this Agreement shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Lifeslice’s failure to assert any right or provision under this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision.</p>
