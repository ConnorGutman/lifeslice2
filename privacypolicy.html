<h2>Information We Collect from Third Parties</h2>

<p>We may collect information that other users provide about you when they use our services. For example, if another user allows us to collect information from their device phonebook—and you’re one of that user’s contacts—we may combine the information we collect from that user’s phonebook with other information we have collected about you. We may also obtain information from other third-party sources and combine that with the information we collect through our services.</p>

<p>Information can be  periodically transmitted to external services to help us improve the Application and our service. We will share your information with third parties in the ways that are described in this privacy statement.</p>

<p>We may disclose User Provided and Automatically Collected Information:</p>
<p>As required by law, such as to comply with a subpoena, or similar legal process;</p>
<p>When we believe in good faith that disclosure is necessary to protect our rights, protect your safety or the safety of others, investigate fraud, or respond to a government request;</p>
<p>With our trusted services providers who work on our behalf, do not have an independent use of the information we disclose to them, and have agreed to adhere to the rules set forth in this privacy statement.</p>

<h2>How We Use Information</h2>

<p>What do we do with the information we collect? The short answer is: Provide you with an amazing set of products and services that we relentlessly improve. But we do a lot more as well, such as:</p>

<p>Develop, improve, deliver, maintain, and protect our products and services</p>
<p>Communicate with you</p>
<p>Monitor and analyze trends and usage</p>
<p>Personalize the services by, among other things, suggesting friends or profile information or providing advertisements, content, or features that match user profiles, interests, or previous activities</p>
<p>Enhance the safety and security of our services</p>
<p>Verify your identity and prevent fraud or other unauthorized or illegal activity</p>
<p>Use information we’ve collected from cookies and other technology to enhance the services and your experience with them</p>
<p>We may also store some information locally on your device. For example, we may store information as local cache so that you can open the app and view content faster.</p>

<p>Although we welcome Lifeslice users from all over the world, keep in mind that no matter where you live or where you happen to use our services, you consent to us processing and transferring information in and to the United States and other countries whose data-protection and privacy laws may offer fewer protections than those in your home country.</p>

<p>We may share information about you in the following ways:</p>

<p><strong>With other Lifeslice users.</strong></p>
<p>We may share the following information about you with other Lifeslice users:</p>
<p>Public information: such as your username, email, name, and profile pictures; Information about how you have interacted with the services, such as the names of Lifeslice users you are friends with, and other information that will help Lifeslice users understand your connections with others using the services. For example, because it may not be clear whether a new friend request comes from someone you actually know, we may share whether you and the requestor have Lifeslice friends in common.</p>

<p><strong>Any additional information you have consented to be shared:</strong> such as when you let us access your device phonebook, we may share information about you with other users who have your phone number in their device phonebook; and content you post or send will be shared with other Lifeslicers and potentially the public at large; how widely your content is shared depends on your personal settings and the type of service you are using. For example, a video may be part of a playlist where the settings specifies that it is only visible to friends, could shared by your friends to other Lifeslice users.</p>

<p><strong>Shared with third parties:</strong>  We may share your information with the following third parties:</p>
<p>With service providers, sellers, and partners. We may share information about you with service providers who perform services on our behalf, sellers that provide goods through our services, and business partners that provide services and functionality.</p>
<p>With third parties for legal reasons. We may share information about you if we reasonably believe that disclosing the information is needed to:</p>
<p>comply with any valid legal process, governmental request, or applicable law, rule, or regulation;</p>
<p>investigate, remedy, or enforce potential Terms of Service violations;</p>
<p>protect the rights, property, and safety of us, our users, or others; or</p>
<p>detect and resolve any fraud or security concerns.</p>
<p>With third parties as part of a merger or acquisition. If Lifeslice gets involved in a merger, asset sale, financing, or acquisition of some portion of our business to another company, we may share your information with that company before and after the transaction closes.</p>
<p>In the aggregate. We may also share with third parties, such as advertisers, aggregated or de-identified information that cannot reasonably be used to identify you.</p>

<h2>Information You Choose to Share with Third Parties</h2>

<p>The services may also contain third-party links, include third-party integrations or be a co-branded or third-party-branded service that’s being provided jointly with or by another company. By going to those links, using the third-party integration, or using a co-branded or third-party-branded service, you may be providing information (including personal information) directly to the third party, us, or both. You acknowledge and agree that we are not responsible for how those third parties collect or use your information. As always, we encourage you to review the privacy policies of every third-party website or service that you visit or use, including those third parties you interact with through our services.</p>

<h2>Choice and Control over Your Information</h2>

<p><strong>Marketing Communications.</strong></p>
<p>If you do not wish to receive promotional emails, you can click the "unsubscribe” button on promotional email communications. Note that you are not permitted to unsubscribe or opt-out of non-promotional messages regarding your account, such as account verification, password or local area number requests, order confirmations, change or updates to features of the App, or technical and security notices.</p>

<p><strong>Online Advertising and Tracking.</strong></p>
<p>We permit third parties, such as ad networks and analytics providers, to collect information about your use of our website over time, in order that they may display ads that may be relevant to your interests or provide us with enhanced demographic and analytic information about our users. For example, we have implemented Google Analytics Demographic and Interest Reporting to provide site demographic reporting. Typically, the information we share with these types of third party providers is provided through cookies or similar tracking technologies. The only way to completely “opt out” of the collection of any information through cookies or other tracking technology is to actively manage the settings on your browser or mobile device. Please refer to your browser’s or mobile device’s technical information for instructions on how to delete and disable cookies, and other tracking/recording tools. Depending on your mobile device, you may not be able to control tracking technologies through settings.</p>

<p><strong>Data Retention.</strong></p>
<p>We will retain your information for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide you services. Following termination or deactivation of your account, Lifeslice may retain information (including User Content) for a commercially reasonable time for backup, archival, and/or audit purposes. Please contact us at privacy@lifeslice.io if you wish to delete your account. Please be aware that we will not be able to delete any content you have shared with others or with social media sites. Also, please be aware that after a prolonged inactivity, your account might be deactivated and could be reactivated only after paying a certain price of our discretion.</p>

<p><strong>Deleting or Anonymizing Your Content.</strong></p>
<p>If you are under 18 years of age, you may request that the User Content that you posted to the App be deleted or anonymized such that your personal information will not be identifiable publicly on our App by sending an email to privacy@lifeslice.io including your full name, email address, Lifeslice username, and the text “I am under 18 years of age and request that you delete or anonymize my content.” While we will use all commercially reasonable efforts to delete or anonymize your User Content upon request, please be aware that due to the social nature of our App, we may not be able to completely remove all of your personally identifiable User Content if, for example, that content has been stored, republished, or reposted by another user or a third party or if you have embedded this information in contents like audio,videos files or others. We may also maintain your information in identifiable form for our internal use, even if your personal data is no longer visible to the public on our App.</p>

<h2>Analytics and Advertising Services Provided by Others</h2>

<p>We may let other companies use cookies, web beacons, and other tracking technologies on the services. These companies may collect information about how you use the services and other websites and online services over time and across different services. This information may be used to, among other things, analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain content, and better understand your online activity.</p>

<p>Additionally, some companies may use the information they collect on our services to deliver targeted advertisements on behalf of us or other companies, including on third-party websites and apps. Lifeslice does not currently respond to do-not-track signals that may be sent from your device. If we do so in the future, we will provide information about that practice in an updated version of this privacy policy.</p>

<h2>Security of Information</h2>

<p>Lifeslice is concerned about safeguarding the confidentiality of your information. We provide physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards to protect information we process and maintain. For example, we limit access to this information to authorized employees and contractors who need to know that information in order notably to operate, develop or improve our Application. Please be aware that, although we strive to provide reasonable security for information we process and maintain, no security system can prevent all potential security breaches. In the event that any information under our control is compromised as a result of a breach of security, we will take reasonable steps to investigate the situation and where appropriate, notify those individuals whose information may have been compromised and take other steps, in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations.</p>

<p>Your information collected through the App may be stored and processed in any other country in which Lifeslice or its subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities. If you are located in the European Union or other regions with laws governing data collection and use that may differ from U.S. law, please note that we may transfer information, including personal information, to a country and jurisdiction that does not have the same data protection laws as your jurisdiction, and you consent to the transfer of information to the U.S. or any other country in which Company or its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates or service providers maintain facilities and the use and disclosure of information about you as described in this Privacy Policy.</p>

<h2>Children</h2>

<p>We do not use the Application to knowingly solicit data from or market to children under the age of 13. If a parent or guardian becomes aware that his or her child has provided us with information without their consent, he or she should contact us at privacy@lifeslice.io. We will delete such information from our files within a reasonable time.</p>

<h2>Revisions to the Privacy Policy</h2>

<p>We may change this privacy policy from time to time. But when we do, we’ll let you know one way or another. Sometimes, we’ll let you know by revising the date at the top of the privacy policy that’s available on our website and mobile application. Other times, we may provide you with additional notice (such as adding a statement to our websites’ homepages or providing you with an in-app notification).</p>

<h2>Your Consent</h2>

<p>By using the Application, you are consenting to our processing of your information as set forth in this Privacy Policy now and as amended by us. "Processing,” means using cookies on a computer/handheld device or using or touching information in any way, including, but not limited to, collecting, storing, deleting, using, combining and disclosing information,</p>
